//number => 2 to power 53 is a range of number
// bigint = if your number is very big than we use bigint instead of number like stockmarket apps. that doesn't mean you cannot store number using numner datatype
//string => "" use in doublecot
//boolean => true/false (only show two value)
//null => standalone value  means value of variable is null means its empty
//undefined => you dont assigned value to the variable
//symbol => to find some uniqueness in components we use symbol
/* this are the premitive datatype */

// object

console.log(typeof undefined); //in JS type of undefined is undefined means undefined is also  itself undefined.
